What a wild ride that was!

Honestly, I'm not quite sure how to put the last four years of my life into a concise post for folks to read! As with any major period of a person's life, there were ups and downs, successes, failures, and every variation of possibilities in between. But looking back on it, I wouldn't change a thing, it has by far been one of the greatest experiences of my life, and to now have the ability to say I have a degree directly related to my dream job is insane to me and something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. 

However, most of all, I'm excited to see what it going to come next! Currently, my only jobs lined up are in the world of theatre, working as tech crew and sound crew for Laguna Playhouse (I'll post more about that when it comes up), and aside from that I'm a free agent. If you're looking for a composer, sound designer, voice actor or general creative for your projects, reach out to me, I promise I'll respond as promptly as I can! Hell, feel free to just say hi if you like. In the meantime though, I'll see you at my next gig!
