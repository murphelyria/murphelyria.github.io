# Changing the fonts used:

Fonts are defined in the CSS for the site, which is generated from the _sass files (which is a templated version of css)

1. Select *all* of the fonts you want to use in the site in Google Fonts
2. Copy the URL into the "@import url(...)" line at the top of the _sass/_main.scss file
3. Edit the $family-sans-serif: '...', ...; line to mimic what Google fonts shows for the "CSS rules" bit
