This is a video game I'm working on currently to have something to showcase for jobs to show I know a little bit of coding and I know how to use GitHub and Unity to collaborate on projects (when I actually get collaborators on this project later on down the line). You can find my GitHub responsitory [here!](https://github.com/murphelyria/wren)

More in depth information on the project can be found in the GitHub repository, check [the Game Journal](https://github.com/murphelyria/wren/tree/master/GameJournal) for a basic overview of the code and the Lore Bible for the game, and [the assets folder](https://github.com/murphelyria/wren/tree/master/Assets) for more in depth comments on individual scripts.
